    Trying to get the animate to ease in and out onTouch:
        - Try moving the this.animate() function into the onTouch method?

    It worked! 
        - Now just have to figure out how to make it fade out properly when touched
        - Get rid of white background when the phone turns over

    - Implementing animatable.js :) Maybe this will be somewhat easier
